                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Medicinal Plants Database of Bangladesh includes the authentic Taxonomic Information,
                        Vernacular/ Bangla Name, Tribal and English Name, Family, Description and Photograph of the
                        Plants, Chemical Constituents, Uses and Distribution of the species in Bangladesh.
                        MPBD also contain dictionary of Botanical and Pharmacological terms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        www.mpbd.info is the first and largest Medicinal Plants Database of Bangladesh. Bangladesh has
                        tremendous wealth of medicinal plants. But unfortunately, there is a lack of systematic efforts
                        to explore and exploit this valuable potential except some sporadic
                        attempts by a few institutions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        One of the greatest difficulties confronting the research workers is the paucity of authentic
                        information on the identity, their distribution and availability, and the use of medicinal
                        plants in this country. Medicinal plants mainly used in the preparations
                        of Unani and Ayurvedic medicine, also prescribed by practitioners of traditional medicine in
                        different parts of the country and others are used as household remedies by the common people.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        In view of the growing interest in traditional medicine all over the world, the publication of
                        "Medicinal Plants of Bangladesh" has undertaken to collect widely dispersed data from different
                        parts of the country with their vernacular names against the
                        scientific names and available literature into one convenient sourcebook for this region, for
                        scientific community and the interested public.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        It is also attempted here to compile information on Bangladeshi medicinal plants with their
                        common English name, their general distribution in Bangladesh and their actions and uses in
                        medicine in a very concise form. It is therefore hoped that this www.mpbd.info
                        besides being useful to research workers engaged in the study of herbal medicines and medicinal
                        plants will also be a valuable guide to those who are involved in commerce and industry of
                        medicinal plants.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        www.mpbd.info are bringing out description of the plants, tribal and local name of the plants,
                        chemical constituents, some antimicrobial and pharmacological information along with coloured
                        photographs. We hope these meet the quest for knowledge on the
                        identification, availability, chemical constituents and medicinal uses of different medicinal
                        plants of the country.
